# Spot-HoloLens-NUI

Controlling the robot with the ```SpotControlDocker```.

Human Control Input through the HoloLens, ```HoloLens-MRTK-NUI```.

Follow the installation instructions on both pages to get everything up and running


## FOR DEV, DELETE AFTER PUTTING PUBLIC
**Required:**
* Maybe include more possible control commands. Like walk left/right and backwards.
    * Alter instruction panel when adding more commands.
* Include direct control for robot arm with impedance. Add toggle button to turn on.


**Would be nice:**
* Demo of Deictic Gaze control in Video, Tell about development and allow pull requests.
* Explain how to add any robot as an interface to be controlled with HoloLens.

## Research paper


### Video
* 10-15 seconds introduction that shows speech and gesture control, operating the robot from both HoloLens view and third person perspective
* Whole experiment according to protocol
  * Eye calibration on HoloLens
  * Instructions experiments
  * Trial 1, Speech Walking
  * Trial 2, Gestures Walking
  * Trial 3, Speech Stationary
  * Trial 4, Gestures Stationary
  * Intra-Experiment questionnnaire, after every trial
  * Post-Experiment Interview
    * What was your favorite and least favorite condition and why
